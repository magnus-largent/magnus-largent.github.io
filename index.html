							<h2>About Me</h2> 
							<p>
								I have been involved with research since 2020, when I began my post-secondary education. I was awarded a competitive research assistant position in the OSU Undergraduate Research Scholarship and the Arts program both my first year and second year. I then continued my research the following summer as an awardee in the OSU College of Science Summer Undergraduate Research Experience program, researching atomically thin materials using a novel method of hyperspectral imaging. I was awarded the 2021 OSU Department of Physics Undergraduate Award for this work. <br /><br />
								In addition to my thesis physics research in atomically thin materials, I also participated in radio astronomy research within the NANOGRAV collaboration. Through that work, I was awarded a position in the NSF International Research Experience for Students, which provided me the opportunity to spend the summer of 2022 at McGill University under Dr. Victoria Kaspi as part of the CHIME collaboration. This summer experience led me to apply to a Master’s of Science program at McGill. <br /><br />
								My M.Sc. was focused on transient radio astronomy, mainly investigating fast radio bursts and pulsars. See below for details. I completed my M.Sc. in August 2025.

									<h2>Searching for pulsars</h2>
									<p>
										<b>Trottier Space Institute, McGill University, Montreal</b> <br />
										During my M.Sc., I was a member of the CHIME All-Sky Multi-Day Pulsar Stack Search (CHAMPSS), which is searching for pulsars in the northern sky by using a novel method of power spectra summation. I created a crucial piece of our survey’s data pipeline; an algorithm to confirm and verify pulsar candidates. My algorithm confirmed the very first pulsars found using CHAMPSS, with 12 new pulsars discovered to date.<br /><br />

							<h2>Dark and Quiet Skies</h2> 
							<p>
								I am interested in advocacy and outreach in the field of “dark and quiet skies”, which refers to mitigating radio and light pollution. The rapid development of cost-effective space launch systems in the past few years has led to an astounding expansion in the number of satellites, including so called ‘mega-constellation’ communication satellites.<br />	<br />								
								These satellites have had a widespread impact on both amateur, professional, and cultural astronomy. It is estimated that in the near future, at certain latitudes during twilight, <a href=”https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab8016”>hundreds of satellites will be visible with the naked eye</a>. Satellites can leave streaks of light that contaminate optical images and contribute to an overall brightening of the night sky due to light reflecting off of them. There are also severe impacts on radio astronomy, since the transmission power of satellites is often several magnitudes stronger than the astrophysical source being observed, <a href=”https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11561”>resulting in contaminated observations</a>. Satellites have even been <a href=”https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2023/08/aa46374-23/aa46374-23.html”>observed to release unintended electromagnetic radiation in the observation bands of radio telescopes </a>, despite these bands being protected by international regulations. Ground-based sources of radio frequency interference, like cellphones and television, can be mitigated by designating radio quiet zones away from populated areas, but satellites cannot strictly be avoided in the same way. <br /><br />
								Many international bodies have emphasized the pressing nature of this subject, with the United Nations adding ‘Dark and Quiet Skies’ to the agenda for the Committee on Peaceful Uses of Outer Space last year and the International Astronomical Union even founding a Centre for the Protection of the Dark and Quiet Sky from Satellite Constellation Interference (IAU CPS) in 2022

									<h3>2024 Montreal Total Eclipse</h3>
									<p>In April of 2024, Montreal experienced a total solar eclipse for the first time in nearly 100 years. As part of the Trottier Space Institute's Solar Eclipse Task force, I designed an eclipse themed outreach activity for elementary schoolers and managed an activity booth for ~100 kids during the day of the eclipse. We distributed 18,000 pairs of eclipse viewing glasses that day.</p>
